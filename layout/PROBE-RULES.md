# PROBE-RULES — every rule, with the incident that earned it

The layout guard (`layout/probe.ts` + `scripts/layout-check.mjs`, run as
`pnpm test:layout`) is the only thing in this repository that can see a
layout. Its rules accumulated one measured incident at a time; this file is
the ledger, so the next amendment starts from what is already known instead
of rediscovering it. Overwrite entries when a rule changes — this is current
truth with citations, not history.

## Why a browser at all

`asked-amount-not-covered` inspects what `themeVars()` returns and never
opens a stylesheet; happy-dom does not lay out. Three defects shipped in one
session under that regime: a grid row stretched to an image's height and
opened a 130px hole, `hidden` lost to a class that set `display`, and a hex
record ran off the side of the sheet. A missing browser **fails the run** —
a guard that quietly does not run is counted as coverage while protecting
nothing.

## Geometry rules

- **Boxes, not hit testing.** A decoration worth the name carries
  `pointer-events: none`, and `elementFromPoint` skips exactly that.
  Measured: a red box laid over a price returned *the price* as the hit.
  Every decoration's box is compared against every protected box.
- **An ancestor counts as covering.** `elementFromPoint` attributes a
  pseudo-element's paint to the element that owns it, so treating ancestors
  as innocent made the first version blind to a shipped decoration over the
  amount.
- **A positioned pseudo-element is refused outright.** It is not in the DOM:
  no `getBoundingClientRect`, no hit — measured: an `::after` with
  `inset: 0` and `pointer-events: none` over the price passed both checks.
  Decorations are real nodes. (This is why the rural tag's punched hole is a
  background radial and the sunburst spins via a registered `@property`
  angle — a rotating wheel's box sweeps the protected address.)
- **The price column is one composed figure.** Its own unit/rate/fiat lines
  sit flush against the amount and the swaying rural tag rotates them
  together; a sibling inside the same `.item-p` is typography, not cover.
- **Seek and measurement share one tree.** `renderStall` throws the tree
  away on every paint; the first over-time loop seeked `getAnimations()`
  then repainted, measuring fresh nodes at t=0 six times. Proved by planting
  a sprite empty at t=0 that covers the screen mid-cycle.
- **A label never wraps** — measured on the *text* via Range rects, because
  a flex label's box stretches to its neighbour ("Token ID" broke across
  two lines beside a wrapped token id at 540px).
- **The theme reaches all four edges.** Measured at 375x812: an 8px border
  and 42% of the screen unthemed, invisible for two months because the
  default is white on a white canvas.
- **Nothing scrolls sideways** — the page and the shell's scroll region,
  which hides its own overflow from the page.
- **The modal is the one scoped exception, stated rather than waived.**
  While a sheet is open, the figures inside *it* must be uncovered and the
  sheet bounded and scrollable; covering the stall behind is what the seller
  opened it to do. The first run reported the scrim covering the price
  behind it — the boundary that had never been written down.
- **The viewport comes from CDP, not `--window-size`.** New headless clamps
  below ~500px: asking for 390 measured 500 while the runner printed 390.
  The runner fails when the page's own measurement disagrees with the ask.
- **The door only wears the default look.** The apex paints
  `view.theme ?? DEFAULT_THEME` and never fetches, so door-under-Neo is a
  screen no visitor can reach — its red was a false alarm (Neo's mini ink
  over the door's light ground) and its green was budget spent on nothing.
- **The name column never collapses under the price** (`.item-b` ≥ 64px).
  The price column is an `auto` track, the name `minmax(0, 1fr)`, and the
  asked figure may not wrap (§8) — measured live at 375px, a `1,000.01`
  price held 189px and every name wore 40px; `100,000,000` left one letter
  per line. No rule watched the name, so `pnpm test:layout` stayed green —
  the absent rule, not an absent fixture, was the hole. `priceTier`'s type
  steps, the tier-3 own-row grid and the glance-line `max-width` are the
  fix this floor keeps honest. Measured on `.item-b`, the grid item: the
  first draft measured `.item-n`, which shrinks to its text
  (`align-items: flex-start`) and reads 26px on "Tea" with 140px of room —
  a false red on short names. Cut points are tuned at this runner's 390px
  mobile viewport; 375 is ~15px tighter and extrapolated, not measured.

## Rendered-pixel contrast (pass 4)

`legibleOn` proves text against the two flat palette roles; only pixels
prove it against what is actually painted behind a figure. The page turns
every target's glyphs transparent, the runner screenshots and samples the
boxes against the declared ink. Floor: `PIXEL_CONTRAST_FLOOR = 3`.

Sampling amendments, each measured:

- **Descendants are blanked too.** A child with its own ink does not
  inherit the blanking: `.tab-name` (the seller's name, muted channel)
  stayed painted and was sampled as "ground" — the shop tab reported at
  1.17:1 against its own sibling text.
- **Borders are chrome, never ground — all four sides.** A dashed pill edge
  blended to 2.2:1 against its ink; later the rural dock's divider, drawn as
  a `border-left` the top-width-only inset never saw, reported 2.3–2.9 on
  tabs whose real ground cleared 5.8.
- **Corner radius narrows the horizontal range** — outside the radius the
  pixels are the page behind the control (Modern's white page behind a white
  pill sampled 1.00:1).
- **Text inside a transformed ancestor gets an 8px pad** — an axis-aligned
  box around rotated content smears border and ground pixels past every
  edge (the swinging wood sign).
- **The scroll clip bounds every sample box.** Content scrolled out of the
  shell's clip keeps its full rect; a studio control's box sampled where
  the dock actually paints reported 1.00:1 against the selected tab's blue.
  Same boundary `coveredBy` already held.
- **The clamp is the nearest scrollable ancestor, whoever that is.** The
  first clamp knew only `.stall-scroll`; the publish sheet scrolls too,
  and its hex past the sheet's own edge sampled at 1.00:1 against
  whatever painted at those coordinates. The shell's region and the
  sheet are one boundary wearing two class names.
- **A clipped sliver is skipped, not sampled.** A control cut to under
  16px at the region's edge holds no line of text — it is all border and
  corner arc, and sampling one reported a pill's terracotta ink against
  its own terracotta top border at 1.04:1. The control is measured in
  full wherever it stands clear of the edge.
- **Boxes are re-read at the last moment before every shot**, after
  `document.fonts.ready`: the self-hosted face swaps metrics when it lands
  and the fit-content dock re-centres with it.
- **The viewport grows to the page height and the paint is redone** —
  `captureBeyondViewport` does not reliably paint backgrounds below the
  fold (a below-fold buy control sampled near-white).
- **A failing box is re-shot once before it is believed** — capture right
  after an emulated resize can raster a stale frame; a real defect is
  steady state.
- **Two glyph-settle frames after blanking** — a shot before a composited
  frame still shows the text (1.00:1 wherever a point landed on a glyph).
- **`color(srgb r g b)` is parsed alongside `rgb()`** — browsers serialize
  `color-mix()` results as srgb floats.
- **The QR is excluded**: black-on-white with a quiet zone by its own rule
  and test, never themed.
- **Both widths.** The desktop chrome is its own set of grounds (fd desktop
  head panels, the 860px column); the first two-width run found the
  translucent Modern dock at 2.48:1 over Drifting light's orbs under After
  hours — mobile-only had certified pixels nobody paints at 1280.

## Reduced motion (pass 3)

- The page's own `matchMedia` answer is required — emulation that silently
  did not apply is the 500px lesson again.
- The pass must measure a non-zero screen list, or it is vacuous green.
- **Stillness is asserted, not assumed** (`reduced motion left something
  running`): every `document.getAnimations()` entry still running under
  emulated reduce is a failure, once per painted combination. Incident: the
  round-3 motion consumers were appended *below* stall.css's reduce block
  and re-won by order — Neo flickered (neo-flick, neo-pulse, neo-sheen) for
  every reduced-motion visitor while the geometry-only pass stayed green.
  The reduce block now sits last in stall.css and says why; theme files
  carry their own reduce blocks, which out-specify it.
- **A waiting transition is a leak too** (`reduced motion left a
  transition armed`): under emulated reduce, any element whose computed
  `transition-duration` is non-zero (with a `transition-property` that is
  not `none`) fails, per painted combination. A transition never appears
  in `getAnimations()` at rest — it only runs while a property is
  mid-change — so the stillness scan above is structurally blind to it.
  Incident 2026-08-31: `.t-modern .item-caret` kept its 0.2s slide under
  reduce because the theme selector (0-2-0) out-specifies stall.css's
  reduce block (0-1-0), and thirteen theme-file transition rules had no
  kill at all. Every theme file's reduce block now sits LAST in its own
  file (stall.css's rule, same measured reason) and names its
  transitions alongside its animations.

## The stream overlay: the canvas pass, and pass 5

`?view=broadcast` is a second render path sized for an OBS Browser Source,
and it broke three of this guard's assumptions at once: it is measured at a
width no pass had, it paints nothing on purpose, and it is composited over
somebody else's video.

- **1920x1080, and nowhere else.** The overlay's chrome is a 252px plate, a
  204px QR and a 39px price. Certifying that at 390px measures pixels nobody
  paints, and the page widths skip it for the same reason in reverse.
  `NO_DECOR_SCREENS` (`layout/fixtures.ts`) is the list, `screensForViewport`
  splits on it, and `?viewport=canvas` is the handshake.
- **The split is audited, not trusted.** Every geometry pass compares the
  screens the page says it measured against `window.__noDecorScreens`: the
  canvas pass must measure all of them and nothing else, the page widths none
  of them, and neither may measure zero. Proved by pointing the canvas pass at
  an empty screen list — `measured 0 screen(s)` instead of a tick over a pass
  that ran nothing.
- **The overlay wears nothing, so it buys one variant.** `renderStall`'s
  broadcast branch keeps only `slot: 'mood'` rows and mounts no ornament, so
  every worn variant is the same tree. `variantsFor` returns the bare list and
  the contrast driver **skips the `wornAll` loop** rather than painting to
  return zero targets — the prepare (a full paint, `document.fonts.ready`, two
  frames) is nearly the whole cost, which is the door-under-Neo lesson again.
- **Two rules are scoped away, stated rather than waived.** "The theme reaches
  all four edges" is the opposite of what `bg=transparent` is for, and the
  `.item-b` name floor is a grid the overlay does not have. The modal remains
  the one scoped exception.
- **A rested card mounts no price.** `mode=rail` shows the name alone for
  three seconds of every eight, and `renderBroadcastView` does not mount
  `.bc-ext` at `data-state='rest'` — same as the rail preset. A hidden
  `[data-role="price"]` is what the covered-amount rule exists to refuse, so
  rest does not leave one in the tree.
- **`[data-role="stall-name"]` is a contrast target.** It is the only line on
  the head plate that is not a money figure, and on a transparent wire it sits
  on the stream with one plate between them.

### `bg=transparent`, in declarations and in pixels

Two halves, because either alone is a lie a reader would believe.

- **The declarations.** On a screen whose `broadcast.transparent` is set,
  `html`, `body`, `#app`, `.frame`, `.stall` and `.bc` must have a
  `background-color` with zero alpha and `background-image: none` —
  `::before` and `::after` **included**. The `html.bc-clear` longhands clear
  element grounds only; a theme pseudo-element painting a backdrop (Neo's
  scanlines are the shape to expect) would survive them unseen. Proved by
  deleting the `html.bc-clear` block from `broadcast.css`: six lines, naming
  `.stall`'s colour and each look's backdrop image.
- **The pixels.** `Emulation.setDefaultBackgroundColorOverride` with `a: 0`
  before the shot, then the frame is flattened in Node onto black **and**
  white and every contrast target is re-sampled against both. This is the only
  reader plate-ink-over-video has: the contrast pass shoots the overlay
  against a themed ground, and
  `a-theme-rule-never-pairs-a-literal-ink-with-a-token-ground` skips a ground
  whose value is `transparent` outright.
- **The alpha is asserted, or the composite is theatre.** Measured 2026-09-02:
  `Page.captureScreenshot { format: 'png', fromSurface: true }` with **no**
  override returns **colour type 2**, flattened onto white — every "over
  black" line would have been a white page wearing a black label. With the
  override, the same call returns **colour type 6** with alpha 0 outside the
  plates; `fromSurface: true` does not flatten it, the override may be set
  before or after navigation, and `captureBeyondViewport` and
  `fromSurface: false` make no difference. PNG alpha is **unpremultiplied** (a
  92% white plate comes back `255,255,255,235`), so the flatten is the
  ordinary `c*a + ground*(1-a)`. The pass therefore fails loudly when the
  capture is not RGBA, when nothing outside the plates is under alpha 255, and
  when the plates cover the whole frame.
- **Moods are measured here even though the contrast pass skips them.** A mood
  is the one worn row that reaches the overlay, and After hours moves the
  plate and its ink together — which is the question CRITIC-2 raised about
  the pairing test. Six combinations: three looks, worn and bare.
- Proved red by a plate at `opacity: 0.35`: twelve lines over black and white,
  including the name plate, while the ordinary contrast pass stayed green at
  1978 boxes. A plate too translucent for a stream is invisible to every other
  rule in this repository.

### Reduced motion, on the fifth sheet

`broadcast.css` ships two keyframes (`bc-in`, `bc-pulse`) and its own reduce
block, and the reduced-motion pass was hard-coded to `offers,publish` — so
nothing had ever executed it. `broadcast` now runs as a second reduced-motion
read at the canvas width, and the fixture carries `broadcastStepped` and
`broadcastPulse` so both classes are on the tree: a runtime-only class is an
animation this guard can never see. Proved by deleting the reduce block — 27
failures naming `bc-in on div.bc-ext.in` and `bc-pulse on span.pulse`.

## Clip-path text containment

A clip-path is invisible to both the box check and the hit test: the
clipped-away region has no paint but the text keeps its rect. Every text
line inside a `polygon(...)`-clipped element must sit inside the polygon
(corners + centre, ray casting, half-pixel edge tolerance). The parser
handles `px`, `%`, bare `0` and single-operation `calc(A% ± Bpx)` — any
other grammar **fails loudly** instead of being measured wrong. Closed
preemptively by the 2026-08-30 review (`.item-p` and `.notice-chip` ship
clips today); no incident yet.

## Billboard (a decoration nobody can see is not a product)

- A **node** row: a real box of sellable size (≥100px²) inside the first
  fold — the first run found the beetle below the fold on every screen.
- A **root** row must change the painted style signature
  (`styleSignature()` — eight properties on three elements; the review
  marked this the guard's weakest joint, to be generalised into a full
  computed-style diff by the catalogue plan).
- A **mood** must move the canvas ≥60 channel-points — the first Sun-faded
  moved it four and a buyer could not tell they were wearing it.

## Budget

`RUNTIME_CEILING_S = 150` (raised from 60 on 2026-08-30 when contrast took
on the desktop width; measured 107–120s). The ceiling is enforcement: the
CLAUDE.md §11 second command has to stay something everyone actually runs.
If the runtime grows again, prune the matrix, do not raise the number
first. The reduced-motion pass re-measures only the animating screens;
state screens buy only the bare and fully-worn variants.

**Every pass now prints what it cost**, because the first session to meet the
ceiling had to guess which pass to prune and the guess would have been wrong:
measured 2026-09-02, the contrast pass is 95–113s of a ~120s run and
everything else together is under 25s, build included. Prune there or nowhere.

**Two prunes paid for the canvas, and neither costs coverage.** The tree
measured 141.0s before this work and 119.7s after, on the same box within an
hour.

- **The second prepare only when the viewport actually grows.** The contrast
  pass paints, learns the page height, grows the viewport and paints again —
  and for every screen that already fits, the second paint, font wait and two
  frames were identical to the first. Nothing repaints between them, so the
  first prepare's tree is the tree that gets shot.
- **The contrast driver has its own screen list** (`__contrastScreens`), not
  `screensToRun()`. The overlay's five screens share one head plate and one
  card: `broadcast` carries every figure the other four do, and an ordinary
  shot of `broadcast-clear` is a shot flattened onto white — which pass 5
  measures properly, over black and white, instead of paying for it twice.

**The number moves ±15% between runs on the same tree** (98.9s and 113.2s for
the same contrast pass, an hour apart). A run near the ceiling is not by
itself a matrix that grew.

## What this guard still cannot see

- Whether a `t-*`-scoped theme override applies on every screen a base var
  consumer paints — `scripts/audit-shadowing.mjs` is static; its SHADOWED
  list stays a candidate list until a DOM pass proves screen coverage.
- Anything in the vitest suite's happy-dom, which does not lay out — the
  two runners cover different failure classes and neither substitutes for
  the other.
- **Worn decorations on the overlay screens, in the ordinary contrast pass.**
  Moods reach the overlay and nothing else does, and they are measured over
  black and white in pass 5 — but never against the themed ground a browser
  visit paints.
- **A stream that is neither black nor white.** Black and white are the
  extremes, not the general case: a plate that clears 3:1 on both can still
  lose against a mid-tone at the wrong hue. Nothing here reads a video.
- **Whether the QR scans.** The guard measures that it is not covered and not
  themed; scanning it from a monitor at 1080p and at 720p is a person with a
  phone, and has not been done.
