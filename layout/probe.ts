/**
 * The rendered-output guard `CLAUDE.md` §6 has been asking for.
 *
 * `asked-amount-not-covered` inspects what `themeVars()` returns and never
 * opens a stylesheet, and happy-dom does not lay out — so the rule that nothing
 * we ship may cover the asked amount has been enforced by reading the diff.
 * Three defects got through in one session because of it: a grid row stretched
 * to an image's height and opened a 130px hole, `hidden` lost to a class that
 * set `display`, and a hex string ran off the side of the sheet.
 *
 * This page paints every shipped look across every screen, measures the result
 * in a real browser, and writes a verdict into the DOM for the runner to read.
 * It asserts what only a browser can see.
